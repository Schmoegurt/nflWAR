\title{Create a Function to Find Replacement Level Based on the Team's Depth}
\usage{
create_roster_replacement_fn(replacement_depth, positions, pbp_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{replacement_depth}{Number indicating which rank on team's depth chart the
replacement level can at most be.}

\item{positions}{String indicating which position(s) to find the replacement level for,
can only be (1) "QB", (2) "RB", (3) "WR", (4) "TE", or (5) "FB".}

\item{pbp_type}{String indicating which type of performance to use, either use
(1) "pass" or (2) "rush".}
}
\value{
Function that returns a vector of Player_ID_Name values indicating the
replacement level for a given play-by-play dataset based on the replacement_depth to
decide the team depth chart cutoff, as well as the position(s) to search for,
and the type of the play-by-play data that will be used.

\examples{
# Create the replacement function for QBs using based on 3rd or higher on the
depth chart using passing performance:
find_replacement_QB <- create_roster_replacement_fn(3, "QB", "pass")
replacement_QBs <- find_replacement_QB(model_data_list)
